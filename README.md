A simple example of [TDLib](https://core.telegram.org/tdlib/getting-started) (Telegram Database Library) authentication using [tdl](https://github.com/Bannerets/tdl) (Node.js package)

User login information (phone number and authentication code) gets by [Telegram API Bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots).

After successfully logging in, if you send "Ping" in your saved messages, you will see that "Pong" sent automatically.
